# leaflet-declarative-layers
A leaflet plugin to abstract away some details of adding data layers to a Leaflet map. Users just need to describe their data with a json object rather than adding each layer with redundant imperative code. Access to map layer references are available, so a user may still access full Leaflet layer methods and features. This project is definitely a work-in-progress and open to contributions.
